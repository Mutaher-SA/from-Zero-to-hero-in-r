## Working directory

## Loading the data

```{r}
interviews <- read_csv(here("data", "SAFI_clean.csv"), na = "NULL")

```

## inspect the data

```{r}
head(interviews)
view(interviews)
glimpse(interviews)
```

## Select column

```{r}

interviews$no_membrs

```

## Selecting columns and filtering rows

```{r}

interviews %>% 
select(village, no_membrs, months_lack_food)

interviews %>% 
select(village:respondent_wall_type)

```

To choose rows based on specific criteria, we can use the `filter()`
function.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
# filters observations where village name is "Chirodzo" 

interviews %>% 
filter(village == "Chirodzo")
```

We can also form "and" statements with the `&` operator instead of
commas:

```{r}

interviews %>% 

filter(village == "Chirodzo" & 
                   rooms > 1 & 
                   no_meals > 2)
```

To form "or" statements we use the logical operator for "or," which is
the vertical bar (\|):

```{r}
# filters observations with "|" logical operator
# output dataframe satisfies AT LEAST ONE of the specified conditions
interviews %>% 
filter(village == "Chirodzo" | village == "Ruaca")

```

The last option, *pipes*, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take
the output of one function and send it directly to the next

```{r}

interviews %>%
    filter(village == "Chirodzo") %>%
    select(village:respondent_wall_type)

```

If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data,
we can assign it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews_ch <- interviews %>%
    filter(village == "Chirodzo") %>%
    select(village:respondent_wall_type)

interviews_ch

```

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in
existing columns.

We might be interested in the ratio of number of household members to
rooms used for sleeping (i.e. avg number of people per room):

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    mutate(people_per_room = no_membrs / rooms)
```

We may be interested in investigating whether being a member of an
irrigation association had any effect on the ratio of household members
to rooms. To look at this relationship, we will first remove data from
our dataset where the respondent didn't answer the question of whether
they were a member of an irrigation association. These cases are
recorded as "NULL" in the dataset.

To remove these cases, we could insert a `filter()` in the chain:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    mutate(people_per_room = no_membrs / rooms)
```

The `!` symbol negates this and says we only want values of `FALSE`,
where `memb_assoc` **is not** missing.

> ## Exercise (15 mins)

> Create a new dataframe from the `interviews` data that meets the
> following criteria: contains only the `village` column and a new
> column called `total_meals` containing a value that is equal to the
> total number of meals served in the household per day on average
> (`no_membrs` times `no_meals`). Only the rows where `total_meals` is
> greater than 20 should be shown in the final dataframe.

> > ```

#### Counting

For example, if we wanted to count the number of rows of data for each
village, we would do:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    count(village)
```

For convenience, `count()` provides the `sort` argument to get results
in decreasing order:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    count(village, sort = TRUE)
```

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the
*split-apply-combine* paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some
analysis to each group, and then combine the results. **`dplyr`** makes
this very easy through the use of the `group_by()` function.

So to compute the average household size by village:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    group_by(village) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))
```

You may also have noticed that the output from these calls doesn't run
off the screen anymore. It's one of the advantages of `tbl_df` over
dataframe.

You can also group by multiple columns:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))
```

Note that the output is a grouped tibble. To obtain an ungrouped tibble,
use the `ungroup` function:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs)) %>%
    ungroup()
```

When grouping both by `village` and `membr_assoc`, we see rows in our
table for respondents who did not specify whether they were a member of
an irrigation association. We can exclude those data from our table
using a filter step.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs))
```

Once the data are grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at
the same time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance,
we could add a column indicating the minimum household size for each
village for each group (members of an irrigation association vs not):

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs),
              min_membrs = min(no_membrs))
```

It is sometimes useful to rearrange the result of a query to inspect the
values. For instance, we can sort on `min_membrs` to put the group with
the smallest household first:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs),
              min_membrs = min(no_membrs)) %>%
    arrange(min_membrs)
```

To sort in descending order, we need to add the `desc()` function. If we
want to sort the results by decreasing order of minimum household size:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
interviews %>%
    filter(!is.na(memb_assoc)) %>%
    group_by(village, memb_assoc) %>%
    summarize(mean_no_membrs = mean(no_membrs),
              min_membrs = min(no_membrs)) %>%
    arrange(desc(min_membrs))
```
